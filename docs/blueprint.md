# **App Name**: Corporate Activity Plan & Dashboard Automation System

## Core Features:

- Activity Planning and Tracking: The system shall provide comprehensive activity planning and tracking features. Managers and Admins will be able to create detailed activity records, including title, description, department, start and end dates, responsible person, and current status (Planned, In Progress, Completed, or Delayed). Staff members will be able to update the status and progress of their assigned activities, while the system automatically maintains an audit trail that records who made changes and when.
- KPI and performance monitoring: For KPI and performance monitoring, the system will allow activities to be linked with measurable performance indicators. It will track KPI targets versus actual achievements and automatically calculate performance percentages, enabling real-time visibility into progress at the activity, departmental, and organizational levels.
- Dashboard and reporting capabilities: The system shall also provide powerful dashboard and reporting capabilities, including visual summaries of activities by status, departmental progress, KPI achievement rates, and upcoming deadlines. Reports such as monthly activity progress, department-wise activity summaries, and KPI performance reports will be automatically generated and made available for export in Excel or PDF formats.
- Notification and alert mechanism: Additionally, the system will include a notification and alert mechanism to ensure timely updates. Reminders for upcoming deadlines will be sent automatically, managers will be notified when staff update activities, and overdue tasks will trigger alerts.
- Data import and export features: To support implementation and ongoing usability, the system will provide data import and export features. Existing data from Excel files can be migrated into the system, and activity lists can be exported for offline use when necessary.
- Security and auditing controls: Finally, the system will enforce robust security and auditing controls. All users will log in securely with encrypted passwords, and the system will log all user actions for auditing purposes.
